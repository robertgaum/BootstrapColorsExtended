# BootstrapColorsExtended
Sometimes you want more color in your bootstrap website, but you can't be bothered to download or create your own theme from scratch. Well, here are several easy to implement colors, complete with hover and active states! These colors are meant to supplement the built-in colors that bootstrap has by default (such as -success or -danger). If you have any suggestions on colors you would like to see added, why not leave a comment?

# How to use:
**Method 1:** External CSS - Simply download the **bootstrap-colors.css** file into your project folder and link to it in your HTML file as you normally would.

**Method 2:** CDN - Paste the following link into your HTML page to directly get the CSS needed for Bootstrap Colors Extended.  
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://bootstrap-colors-extended.herokuapp.com/bootstrap-colors.css" />```

All normal bootstrap colors are still usable as normal! The following colors are currently available with BootstrapColorsExtended:

indigo  
teal  
orange  
pink  
maroon  
navy 
yellow  
lime  
gray  
brown  
grape  
vermillion  

The above colors also have -light and -dark versions for **text color, background color, and border color**!

**The following bootstrap tags are supported (where * donates one of the above colors):**
```
bg-*
text-*
border-*
bg-*-light
bg-*-dark
text-*-light
text-*-dark
border-*-light
border-*-dark
btn-*
btn-outline-*
table-*
thead-*
badge-*
alert-*
list-group-item-*
```

All tags work correctly with their hover and active states.
